# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to help the chief data scientist of a city school district combine data from multiple sources and provide insights on student performance trends. Specifically, we looked at how student performance by grade, school type (district or charter), budget (per student), and size (number of students). After the original analysis, there were some questions about the integrity of 9th grade reading and math scores at one particular school. It was decided that those data points would be removed and we performed the analysis again to see whether or not that changed outcomes.

## Results<br/>

From this, we can see that removing the data in question did not significantly alter district-wide scores. In fact, the only difference is that the average math score dropped by .1 points.<br/><br/><br/>

After removing the math and reading scores from Thomas High School, we can see that average scores and the percentage of students passing both math and reading, was largely unchanged. <br/><br/><br/>


### Scores by: Grade, School Spending, School Size, and School Type
In the tables below, Thomas High School, or the category it falls into is highlighted. These tables show us that after removing the 9th math and reading scores at Thomas High School, the overall analysis was virtually unaffected. This means we can feel confident that our analysis is still realiable after removing that data.<br/><br/>
