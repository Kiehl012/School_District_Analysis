# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to help the chief data scientist of a city school district combine data from multiple sources and provide insights on student performance trends. Specifically, we looked at how student performance by grade, school type (district or charter), budget (per student), and size (number of students). After the original analysis, there were some questions about the integrity of 9th grade reading and math scores at one particular school. It was decided that those data points would be removed and we performed the analysis again to see whether or not that changed outcomes.

## Results

From this, we can see that removing the data in question did not significantly alter district-wide scores. In fact, the only difference is that the average math score dropped by .1 points.
